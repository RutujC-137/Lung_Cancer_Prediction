# Lung_Cancer_using_Predictive_Modeling_and_Analysis
This project aims to develop an efficient Lung Cancer Prediction to enable early and accurate diagnosis, thereby improving patient outcomes. This Lung Cancer Prediction using Predictive Modeling and Analysis leverages machine learning to build a predictive model that analyzes large-scale patient data to identify individuals at high risk and classify potential cancer cases. The system leverages Apache Spark for big data processing, MySQL for data storage, and various Machine Learning algorithms like XGBoost, SVM, and Logistic Regression for core prediction. Given that the dataset largely consists of categorical data, appropriate preprocessing will be applied using relevant Python packages. A Streamlit web framework provides the user interface for input and real-time predictions, while Tableau is used to build interactive dashboards for data visualization and performance insights. This integrated approach offers a scalable and practical solution to enhance early lung cancer detection.
